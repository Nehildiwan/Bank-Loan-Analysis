This project helped me showcase my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and strategic decision-making within the banking and lending domain. I performed a comprehensive analysis of the bank's loan portfolio, identifying key trends and opportunities. I designed visually compelling data dashboards to effectively communicate loan-related metrics and insights. Based on my analysis, I formulated actionable recommendations to optimize lending strategies, enhance client relationships, and promote data-driven decision-making. Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to extract valuable insights from complex data, create informative data visualizations, and leverage data-driven approaches to drive strategic business initiatives.
